<p class="test">Hi.</p>
<p class="test">My name is Arjun Lalith, I am a junior currently studying Computer Engineering at Texas A&amp;M.</p>
<p class="test">In my spare time I enjoy listening to podcasts, audiobooks and music</p>
<p class="test">My favorite podcast is the <a href="https://podcasts.joerogan.net">Joe Rogan Experience</a> because he brings a variety of guests from different backgrounds. My favorite episode of the podcast is the one featuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udlMSe5-zP8">John Carmack</a>. John Carmack was the lead developer for Doom, Quake, and Wolfenstein 3D. He has since gone on to become the CTO of Oculus Rift. It was amazing to see just how knowledgeable Carmack was in the field of computing, and I was amazed to find out that he still writes code.</p>
<p class="test">Recently I have been reading the book <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport. In an age where everyone is connected via their phone, we have become a slave to our phones. Social Media like Instagram and Facebook create distractions that make us lose our focus on the tasks we are trying to accomplish.</p>
