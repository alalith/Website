<p class="test"><b>Covenant Child Life</b></p>
<p class="test">Last summer I volunteered at Covenant Children's hospital in Lubbock, TX. As a Child Life Volunteer, I ensured that toys and equipment in play rooms were kept clean, in order to prevent further spread of diseases in the hospital. This allowed the kids to recover in the hospital without having to be worried about getting bored during their extended stay. I also kept kids entertained, as many kids either did not have siblings or had limited visition hours.</p>

<p class="test"><b>Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation</b></p>
<p class="test">In December of 2018 I visited India with my family. I met many of my relatives that I have not seen in many years. One relative that I met was my Grandmother's younger sister. When I visited her five years prior she seemed perfectly healthy. But when I visited her again recently, she had gotten Alzheimer's and had deteriorated. She was unable to speak and needed assistance to go to the bathroom. This made me realize just how destructive Alzheimer's is to someone, making them a shell of their former self. I would suggest donating to <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org">Fischer Center for Alzheimer's Research</a> so that we may one day find a cure to this devastating disease. </p>
